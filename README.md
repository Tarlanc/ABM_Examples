# ABM_Examples
In this repository, some examples of Agent Based Models are shared. The models are written in R and Python and may be used to study the feasibility and intricacies of ABMs.

## COVID-19.R
This simulation uses a network graph to simulate the contagion of a contagious agent (inspired by Sars-CoV2) through a small network with one initially infected agent.
